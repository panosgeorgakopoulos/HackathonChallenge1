# 🌊 Marine Heatwave Predictor for Aquaculture

> **Developed during the French Hackathon at the Institut français de Grèce.**

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a predictive model designed to forecast **Marine Heatwaves (MHWs)**. 

Developed during the **French Hackathon**, our goal was to address a critical environmental and economic challenge: the impact of rising ocean temperatures on **aquaculture (fish farming)**. By predicting heatwaves in advance, we aim to provide producers with the data they need to take preventative measures, safeguarding marine life and ensuring production stability.

## 🎯 The Challenge

Marine heatwaves are prolonged periods of anomalously high sea surface temperatures. For the aquaculture industry, these events can be catastrophic, leading to:
* High mortality rates in fish stocks.
* Significant economic losses for producers.
* Long-term environmental stress.

**The Goal:** Create a reliable tool that analyzes historical and real-time data to predict the onset of these heatwaves.

## ⚙️ How It Works

This project utilizes **[Python]** and **[XGBoost]** to analyze sea temperature trends.

**Key Features:**
* **Data Ingestion:** Processing of [mention data source, e.g., satellite data / Copernicus marine service].
* **Prediction Model:** Algorithms optimized to detect temperature anomalies.
* **Alert System:** (Prototype phase) Logic to flag when thresholds are exceeded.


## 🚀 Roadmap

This project is currently in the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** stage. Our future development plans include:

* [ ] Refactoring code into a modular architecture.
* [ ] Improving model accuracy with larger datasets.
* [ ] Developing a user-friendly frontend dashboard for producers.
* [ ] **Startup Evolution:** Scaling this solution into a commercial product for the Blue Economy.
